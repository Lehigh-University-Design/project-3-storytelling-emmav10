                <p>On the morning of October 19, 2025, the Louvre art museum in Paris, France was robbed of some of the monarchs’ crown jewels in broad daylight, while the museum was open. The biggest kicker, the crime was committed in under eight minutes. This phenomenon has since taken the world by storm.  People across the globe have taken to the internet saying things like “this is just what the world needed to bring us together” or that there is “nothing people love more than a good heist” and that “this is just like Ocean’s Eleven!” The excitement over this occurrence has been astronomical, which makes the event all the more significant.</p>

                        <p>On the morning of October 19, 2025, the Louvre art museum in Paris, France was robbed of some of the monarchs’ crown jewels in broad daylight, while the museum was open. The biggest kicker, the crime was committed in under eight minutes. This phenomenon has since taken the world by storm.  People across the globe have taken to the internet saying things like “this is just what the world needed to bring us together” or that there is “nothing people love more than a good heist” and that “this is just like Ocean’s Eleven!” The excitement over this occurrence has been astronomical, which makes the event all the more significant.</p>

                        <p>One piece of incredibly significant information regarding all of this is that the Louvre is home to the Mona Lisa, which is famous primarily because it was stolen in 1911, and was missing for two years before it was returned to its rightful place. We now get the privilege to watch and see if history will repeat itself. Will these jewels find their way home? Will it be in one piece? How long will it take? How much more significant will the Louvre, an already world-famous museum, become if it houses multiple thieved and returned pieces of invaluable art? We all get to watch as this unfolds.</p>

                        <p>The world of marketing is now also jumping at the opportunity to highlight this catastrophic event to consumers. Böcker, the company that makes the basket lift, is the most significant of these marketers, as they released a new ad the very next day. Using a photo of their product under the Louvre balcony, the ad reads, “When you’re in a hurry, the Böcker Agilo carries your heavy treasures.” Chief executive, Alexander Böcker, emphasized this as Germans’ chance to prove that they have a sense of humor. Lionsgate film studio is also notably benefiting from this, as they are releasing a new movie in the “Now You See Me” franchise in early November, which contains the stories of Robin Hood-style thieves who practice magic. They have released short videos on social media connecting the announcement of the Louvre news to the thievery in their upcoming movie.</p>

People are comparing the situations to countless movies where you root for a protagonist to “get away with it” and are saying that it is one of the most entertaining things that can happen.</p>
